Generates an [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) workspace from a microservice definition file.

## Disclaimer

This is not meant to be a maintained project. This was just a useful script I needed at a time.

I leave it public here if you are interested to see how to generate an Insomnia workspace on-the-fly.
